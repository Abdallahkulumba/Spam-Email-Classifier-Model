# Spam Email Classifier Model

## Project Description
The Spam Email Classifier Model is a machine learning project designed to classify email messages as either spam or not spam (ham). This project utilizes various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of emails and determine their classification. The goal is to help users filter out unwanted spam emails effectively.

## Project Goals
- To develop an accurate model for classifying emails as spam or ham.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for users to classify their emails.
- To contribute to the research in spam detection and filtering.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Abdallahkulumba/Spam-Email-Classifier-Model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Spam-Email-Classifier-Model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
To run the project, execute the following command in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment:
```python
# Example of using the classifier
from model import SpamClassifier

classifier = SpamClassifier()
classifier.train_model()
result = classifier.predict("Your email content here")
print(result)  # Output: 'spam' or 'ham'
```
### Example Scenarios
- Classifying a promotional email from a retailer.
- Filtering out phishing attempts disguised as legitimate emails.

## Future Work
- Implementing a web interface for easier access to the classifier.
- Exploring advanced machine learning techniques to improve accuracy.
